Title: Install Packages from Snapshots on the Checkpoint Server for
    Reproducibility
Description: The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package
    reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install packages
    as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time
    machine. To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function installs the
    packages required or called by your project and scripts to a local library
    exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only those packages
    are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came
    later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's
    checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any
    time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft
    refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the "Microsoft R Archived Network"
    server (<https://mran.microsoft.com/>). Immediately after completion
    of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a snapshot, thus creating the
    archive. Snapshot archives exist starting from 2014-09-17.
