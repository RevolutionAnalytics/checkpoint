\description{
This function decides what to do with your repository based on commands you give, and on skimming through your repo. You can run this function to start a new repository, without any work done yet, creating a new folder and RRT files, or you can initiate a RRT repository inside an existing project/folder you already have. If the latter, we don't alter your files at all, but simply write a few files needed for RRT to work properly.
}
\details{
By detault initialization is done interactively, so that you can choose your settings or accept reasonable defaults.

You can run this function to start a new RRT repo, and to refresh a repo with new work. This function downloads packages and installs them, as needed.
